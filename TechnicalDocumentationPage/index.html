            <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language used for front-end web development. It's a scripting language that allows developers to create interactive elements on web pages, such as dynamic forms, animated graphics, and responsive user interfaces. JavaScript is also used to build server-side applications using Node.js, which allows developers to run JavaScript on a server and create back-end systems.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>JavaScript is a loosely-typed, dynamically-typed language, which means that variables don't have to be declared with a specific type and can change type at runtime. It's also a multi-paradigm language, supporting both object-oriented and functional programming.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers and is one of the core technologies of the web, making it an essential skill for front-end web development.</p>

            <p>Java and JavaScript are both programming languages but they have different syntax, paradigms and use cases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Java is an object-oriented, statically-typed, general-purpose programming language designed for building complex, large-scale applications. It is primarily used to develop desktop applications, mobile applications, and back-end systems.</li>
                <li>JavaScript is a dynamically-typed, high-level, interpreted programming language that is used primarily for front-end development. It's commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers and to develop server-side applications using Node.js.  </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In short, Java is a powerful language for complex applications, while JavaScript is a flexible language for building interactive web applications.</p>

        <section id='Hello_World' class='main-section'>
            <header>Hello World</header>
            <hr>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
            <code>
                function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                greetMe("World");
            </code>
            <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
            <p>You can run this code in the JavaScript console in your web browser's developer tools, or you can save it as a .js file and run it using a JavaScript interpreter such as Node.js.</p>

            <header>Variables</header>
            <hr>
            <p>In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values. You can declare a variable using the "var" keyword (although it's recommended to use "let" or "const" instead), followed by the name of the variable. For example:</p>
            <code>let message = "Hello, World!";</code>
            <p>Here, "message" is the name of the variable and "Hello, World!" is the value assigned to it. The value can be of any data type, such as a string, number, boolean, or even an object.</p>
