                <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language used for front-end web development. It's
                    a
                    scripting language that allows developers to create interactive elements on web pages, such as
                    dynamic
                    forms, animated graphics, and responsive user interfaces. JavaScript is also used to build
                    server-side
                    applications using Node.js, which allows developers to run JavaScript on a server and create
                    back-end
                    systems.</p>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                    extended
                    for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and
                        its
                        Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                        elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                        navigation.</li>
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                        JavaScript
                        on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                        database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application,
                        or
                        perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>JavaScript is a loosely-typed, dynamically-typed language, which means that variables don't have to
                    be
                    declared with a specific type and can change type at runtime. It's also a multi-paradigm language,
                    supporting both object-oriented and functional programming.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers and is one of the core technologies of the web,
                    making
                    it an essential skill for front-end web development.</p>

                <p>Java and JavaScript are both programming languages but they have different syntax, paradigms and use
                    cases:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Java is an object-oriented, statically-typed, general-purpose programming language designed for
                        building complex, large-scale applications. It is primarily used to develop desktop
                        applications,
                        mobile applications, and back-end systems.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript is a dynamically-typed, high-level, interpreted programming language that is used
                        primarily for front-end development. It's commonly used to create interactive effects within web
                        browsers and to develop server-side applications using Node.js. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>In short, Java is a powerful language for complex applications, while JavaScript is a flexible
                    language
                    for building interactive web applications.</p>

                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                    JavaScript
                    code:</p>
                <code>
                    function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                    greetMe("World");
                </code>
                <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
                <p>You can run this code in the JavaScript console in your web browser's developer tools, or you can
                    save it
                    as a .js file and run it using a JavaScript interpreter such as Node.js.</p>

            <article>
                <hr>
                <p>In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values. You can declare a variable using the "var"
                    keyword (although it's recommended to use "let" or "const" instead), followed by the name of the
                    variable. For example:</p>
                <code>let message = "Hello, World!";</code>
                <p>Here, "message" is the name of the variable and "Hello, World!" is the value assigned to it. The
                    value
                    can be of any data type, such as a string, number, boolean, or even an object.</p>
                <p>It's worth noting that in JavaScript, variables declared with var are function scoped, while
                    variables
                    declared with let or const are block scoped. This means that variables declared with let and const
                    are
                    only accessible within the block of code in which they are declared, while var variables can be
                    accessed
                    throughout the entire function.</p>
                <code>let x = 10;
                    x = 20; // valid, you can reassign a value to a variable declared with let
                    
                    const y = 30;
                    y = 40; // invalid, you can't reassign a value to a variable declared with const
                    </code>
                <p>In conclusion, you can use variables in JavaScript to store and manipulate data, and it's important
                    to
                    choose the appropriate keyword (var, let, or const) based on your intended scope and whether or not
                    you
                    want to allow the value to be reassigned.</p>

                <p>In JavaScript, you can declare variables using the var, let, or const keywords.</p>
                <p>Here's an example of declaring a variable using var:</p>
                <code>var name = "John Doe";</code>
                <p>Here's an example of declaring a variable using let: </p>
                <code>let age = 30;</code>
                <p>And here's an example of declaring a variable using const: </p>
                <code>const PI = 3.14;           </code>
                <p>It's worth noting that var is function scoped, while let and const are block scoped. This means that
                    variables declared with let and const are only accessible within the block of code in which they are
                    declared, while var variables can be accessed throughout the entire function.</p>
                <p>In general, it's recommended to use let or const instead of var, as they provide better scope control
                    and
                    make your code more maintainable and predictable. </p>

                <hr>
                <p>In JavaScript, an if-else statement is used to execute a block of code based on a condition. The
                    syntax
                    for an if-else statement is as follows:</p>
                <code>if (condition) {
                    // code to be executed if the condition is true
                } else {
                    // code to be executed if the condition is false
                }
                </code>
                <ul>
                    <li>Here, condition is a boolean expression that evaluates to either true or false. If the condition
                        is
                        true, the code inside the first block (between the curly braces {}) will be executed. If the
                        condition is false, the code inside the second block will be executed instead.</li>
                    <li>Here's an example of an if-else statement in action: </li>
                    <li><code>let score = 75;
    
                        if (score >= 60) {
                        console.log("You passed the exam!");
                        } else {
                        console.log("You failed the exam. Better luck next time.");
                        }
                        </code></li>
                    <li>In this example, the value of score is compared to 60. If score is greater than or equal to 60,
                        the
                        message "You passed the exam!" will be logged to the console. If score is less than 60, the
                        message
                        "You failed the exam. Better luck next time." will be logged to the console instead.</li>
                </ul>
